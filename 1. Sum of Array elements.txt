1. Sum of Array elements
Given an array of integers, find the sum of the elements of the given array.
Note: Try to solve this without declaring/storing the array elements.

Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N - the size of the array and second line contains the elements of the array.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= ar[i] <= 1015

Output Format

For each test case, print the sum of the elements of the array, separated by new line.

Code:
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    t=int(input())
    arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
    S=0
    for j in range(t):
        S=S+arr[j]
    print(S)
